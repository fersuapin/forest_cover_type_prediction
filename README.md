# forest_cover_type_prediction
Use cartographic variables to classify forest categories (Kaggle Competition)

The goal of this machine learning project is to build a model that is able to predict the forest
cover type, which is the predominant type of tree cover, from cartographic variables.

There are seven different cover types, namely, 1 = Spruce/Fir, 2 = Lodgepole Pine, 3 =
Ponderosa Pine, 4 = Cottonwood/Willow, 5 = Aspen, and 6 = Douglas-fir & 7 =Krummholz.

In this project we will go through the machine learning process of understanding the data,
followed by data cleaning and preparation, feature engineering, model selection,
evaluation, then optimization, to find the best model to predict the classes.
